### U-Tube Fluid Dynamics Simulation

This interactive notebook simulates the fluid dynamics of a U-tube system. Users can modify parameters such as fluid density, damping coefficient, and initial fluid levels to observe their effects on the system. The notebook includes visualizations of displacement, velocity, and phase space.
