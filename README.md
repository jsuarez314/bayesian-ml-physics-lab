### 1. U-Tube Fluid Dynamics Simulation
This notebook simulates the fluid dynamics of a U-tube.  
You can adjust parameters such as fluid density, damping coefficient, and initial heights.  
The simulation displays the U-tube, displacement, velocity, and phase space plots.

### 2. Bayesian Estimation of Position and Velocity
This notebook demonstrates how to estimate the **position** and **velocity** of an object using Bayesian inference with the `emcee` library.  
It walks through data generation, likelihood modeling, and parameter estimation.
